# Open Disclosure

A web app to track campaign finances for the California Primary Election (March 3, 2020), 
and the General Election (November 3, 2020). The goal of Open Disclosure is to help voters 
understand who/what Political Action Committees (PACs) are donating money to the candidates/measures. 
Are the donors from the same jurisdiction (city/county/state) as the candidate's intended office or 
outside of the jurisdiction? Are the donors individuals, or Political Action Committees (PACs)? What 
is the donor history of the PAC(s)?

We are inspired by Open Oakland's Open Disclosure: https://www.opendisclosure.io

Initially this project will cover City of San Jose elections and later will broaden to cover elections more widely.

## How to Launch the Scraper

### MacOS:

```
% cd data_pipeline/scraper 
% virtualenv env
% source env/bin/activate

(env) % python3 -m pip install chromedriver_binary webdriver-manager selenium xlrd pymysql sqlalchemy

(env) % python ./scraper.py
```
### Windows:

```
% cd data_pipeline/scraper
% virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ./venv
% .\venv\Scripts\activate

(env) % python3 -m pip install chromedriver_binary webdriver-manager selenium xlrd pymysql sqlalchemy
(env) % python3 scraper.py
```

The example above uses virtualenv to help create a clean working environment and help you not pollute the spaces
of other python applications you may use.
