# Open Disclosure

A web app to track campaign finances for the California Primary Election (March 3, 2020), 
and the General Election (November 3, 2020). The goal of Open Disclosure is to help voters 
understand who/what Political Action Committees (PACs) are donating money to the candidates/measures. 
Are the donors from the same jurisdiction (city/county/state) as the candidate's intended office or 
outside of the jurisdiction? Are the donors individuals, or Political Action Committees (PACs)? What 
is the donor history of the PAC(s)?

We are inspired by Open Oakland's Open Disclosure: https://www.opendisclosure.io

Initially this project will cover City of San Jose elections and later will broaden to cover elections more widely.

## Draft Stories

Minimal Viable Product (MVP) / Version 1:
The aim is to have a prototype website with simple visualizations up and running by December 31, 2019.  

1. A user can see a list of election categories:
- Mayoral candidates of City of San Jose
- Council member candidates of City of San Jose
2. The user can select one category
3. The user can select one candidate
4. The user will see a list of donors, from highest donation to lowest donation. Include information 
about the donor like donation amount and location. Also include information about expenditures, 
broken down into categories, recipients and amounts.
5. The user can see a list of where the donors are from: San Jose, Santa Clara County, California, Other States

As a first pass this will cover data from the 2018 elections as this is readily available.

Version 2:

The aim is to prettify the website and visualizations from January - February 2020, ideally by February 3, 2020, 
one month before the Primary Election on March 3, 2020. 

1. General improvements to UX/UI of website
2. Incorporate data from 2020 elections as it becomes available.
